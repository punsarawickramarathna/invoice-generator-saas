# Explanation: Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

## Why Blue-Green?

It allows zero-downtime deployment. You maintain two environments:

- **Blue (Current production)**
- **Green (Staging/testing)**

After testing, simply switch traffic to Green and make it live.

## Benefits
- Fast rollback
- Safer deployments
- Better testing
