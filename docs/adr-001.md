# ADR-001: Deployment Platform Decision

## Context
Our application is a static site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We considered Firebase Hosting for deployment, which supports multiple environments (dev, staging, prod).

## Decision
We chose **GitHub Pages** over Firebase due to its simplicity and seamless integration with GitHub Actions CI/CD. Our application doesn't require backend logic, so GitHub Pages is ideal for static hosting.

- `main` branch = Production
- We simulate staging by using a `staging` branch with GitHub Pages deployment enabled (optional).

## Status
Accepted
