### Backup & Recovery

- GitHub serves as version control and backup. Any lost file can be recovered via commit history.  
To take a backup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

- UptimeRobot monitors our production GitHub Pages site.
- In case of issues:
  1. Check UptimeRobot dashboard
  2. Review recent commits
  3. Revert to last stable version
  4. Redeploy via GitHub Pages
