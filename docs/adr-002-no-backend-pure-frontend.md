# ADR-002: No Backend â€“ Pure Frontend SaaS

## Status
Accepted

## Context
This project only needs client-side logic for invoice generation.

## Decision
We opted to keep the app frontend-only using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Consequences
- Simplifies deployment and maintenance
- No data persistence unless backend is added later
